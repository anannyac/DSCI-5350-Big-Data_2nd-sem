Midterm review:
---------------

1. When using query option:
a. You must have the literal WHERE $CONDITIONS
b. You must have target dir option

Page 15 - Lecture 3 slide

2. Note that there is a --target-dir option as
well which creates the tables in the target dir
without creating sub directories.

Page 9- Lecture 3 slide


3.Index related question:
There were 2 options which were correct .
I chose those 2. But on top of that, I chose one more wrong option as well. So I got partial marks. (1.25/2.5)


4.
In place of the map name 'Vehicle', I chose the key word 'map' itself making the answer wrong.


5.
Page 30 and 31 - Lecture 3 slide

Use the --staging-table parameter in your sqoop command for all or nothing export.
Sqoop will load to the staging table first and then will load to
the table specified in the table parameter
•
The load to the table destination will only happen when
the staging table is completely loaded
•
Both staging and final tables should have the same metadata.
